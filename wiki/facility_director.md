## Overview

The Facility Director commonly shortened to (FD) is an executive facility team that is in command of the entire facility. They are the highest rank in the facility, above Council Executives. FDs can access any team locker and can open doors without the need for a keycard, as well as being able to broadcast announcements without being in the Broadcast Room using the Facility Control Tablet. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Gameplay

The Facility Director spawns in the SCC (Strategic Command Center) in the Director’s Office.  
The Facility Director has access to everything in the facility, excluding admin areas. They have the strongest facility weapons in the game, so they often defend the facility from raiders. They also can make announcements and change the alert level of the facility. Additionally, just like the Council Executives, they have access to the Master Teleporter room.

The gamepass also allows players that have bought it to obtain director items from the armory, even if they are not on the Facility Director team. It also unlocks access to all executive vehicles. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
